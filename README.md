# workbook

My workbook, for storing my material working through workshops and other learning material. Currently working through Rechard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking

## Workshops in progress

- *McElreath's Statistical Rethinking:* I realised I have never done statistics formally, picking things up from other around me naturally. 
  In a new field now, and isolated from such interactions I want to continue my learning. Also this allows me to understand reasons for why I am doing things
  certain ways already. I was drawn to this course for the fundamental focus on scientific thinking
  and aproach to not using one stop packages for learning (The handmade hero aproach in statistics).

## Workshops finished

- *DataTalkClub's ml-zoomcamp:* Introductionary course on ML pipelines and deployments
