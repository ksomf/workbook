# Lecture 5: Elemental Confounds

## Fork

\begin{tikzcd}
A & B \arrow[l] \arrow[r] & C
\end{tikzcd}

- Causes **phantom** association between $A$ and $C$
- Stratification by $B$ **removes** this association
- $A\: \cancel{\Perp}\: B$ and $A \Perp{} B \:|\: C$
- Also known as a 'common cause'

## Pipe

\begin{tikzcd}
A \arrow[r] & B  \arrow[r] & C
\end{tikzcd}

- Causes **indirect** association between $A$ and $C$
- Stratification by $B$ **removes** this association
- $A\:\cancel{\Perp}\: B$ and $A \Perp{} B \:|\: C$
- Also known as a 'chain' or 'mediator'

## Collider

\begin{tikzcd}
A \arrow[r] & B   & C \arrow[l]
\end{tikzcd}

- **No** association between $A$ and $C$
- Stratification by $B$ **causes** association
- $A \Perp{} B$ and $A\:\cancel{\Perp}\: B \:|\: C$
- Also known as a 'collider'

## Descendant

\begin{tikzcd}
A & B \arrow[l] \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & C \\
  & D &
\end{tikzcd}

- $D$ inherits whatever association $B$ is subject to
