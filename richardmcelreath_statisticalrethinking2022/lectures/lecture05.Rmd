# Lecture 5: Elemental Confounds

## Fork

\begin{tikzcd}
A & B \arrow[l] \arrow[r] & C
\end{tikzcd}

- Causes **phantom** association between $A$ and $C$
- Stratification by $B$ **removes** this association

## Pipe

\begin{tikzcd}
A \arrow[r] & B  \arrow[r] & C
\end{tikzcd}

- Causes **indirect** association between $A$ and $C$
- Stratification by $B$ **removes** this association

## Collider

\begin{tikzcd}
A \arrow[r] & B   & C \arrow[l]
\end{tikzcd}

- **No** association between $A$ and $C$
- Stratification by $B$ **causes** association

## Descendant

\begin{tikzcd}
A & B \arrow[l] \arrow[r] \arrow[d] & C \\
  & D &
\end{tikzcd}

- $D$ inherits whatever association $B$ is subject to
