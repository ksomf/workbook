# Lecture 2: Introdution to Bayesian Infference
How can we measure what percentage of the earth is covered with water; Spherical uniform sampling. But how do we quantify uncertainty in our measurement. Use Bayesian data analysis.
TODO submodule the plotting code from the lecture and input the blue marble here.

In essence it is all just counting. The advantage of this is that we can update our most likely conjecture by taking another measurement (Baysian updating).

 1. State a causal model for observations arrise, given each possible explanation
 2. Count the ways the data could arrive for each explanation
 3. Relative plausibility is relative value from (2)
